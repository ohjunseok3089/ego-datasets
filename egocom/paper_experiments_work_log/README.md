# EgoCom paper & experiments work log

This folder provides a work log of snapshots of the code used to:
1. Create the EgoCom Dataset
2. Compute and analyze the results of the Global Transcription experiments in the [EgoCom paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9200754).
3. Compute and analyze the results of the Turn-taking experiments in the EgoCom paper.

Jupyter Notebook files are provided, instead of script .py Python files because
this code **NOT** intended to be executable *as is*. Some code may depend on files / paths, which no longer exist.
